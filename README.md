Determining if a Number is Prime
blocks
Copy code
when green flag clicked
set [number v] to (13)
if <(number) is prime> then
    say [The number is prime!] for (2) seconds
else
    say [The number is not prime.] for (2) seconds
end

Calculating Factorial
blocks
Copy code
when green flag clicked
set [number v] to (5)
set [result v] to (factorial of (number))
say (join [The factorial of ] (number) [ is ] (result)) for (2) seconds
